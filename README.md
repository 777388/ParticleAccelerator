# ParticleAccelerator
Just a small update to 16ParticleAccelerator, this sends the binary memory collision out as a Wget command and pulls it in.


Signal Handler is broken in Commandprompt as well as power shell, so wsl this if you wind up with the same issue

usage:

python3 accelerate 

ctrl+c to implement wget and stop the accelerator

This is proving to be a useful adversary to the idea of "On Line" where neurology memory systems linked to computing energies are being limited by computers abilities, despite "Next Gen" technologies. Due to the fact that current systems do not account for the innate human nature of electrolysis expansion within brain fluid not being a construct of a single directional system. This construct implies that withhin a fluid, the arcing patterns are much more complex than a single line wait valuable asset accomplish project towards an activation model. Use wisely.
